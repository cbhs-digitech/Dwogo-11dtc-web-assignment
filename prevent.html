    <h1 class="title">How to prevent a ransomware attack</h1>
    <br />
    <section>
      <p class="prevent-title">
        Firstly how do you get ransomware on your device
      </p>

      You can get ransomware by many means but what it boils down to is that you
      download the infected software and run it. This can be from an attachment
      on an email, downloading from a sketchy website, using a random USB that
      you just found, etc.
    </section>

    <section>
      <p class="prevent-title">So now how do we prevent it</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          1. Double check that the site you are downloading from is legitimate and is
          from the authors of the software.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          2. You should never click an unverified link, it's very 
          easy for a hacker to just add a link that redirects you to a download page.
        </li> 
        <br />
        <li>
          3. Scan emails for malware, there are a variety of email scanning services available
          and some are built into your email utility.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          4. Keep backups, the effects of an attack would be mitigated 
          if you have important files stored offsite (preferably in the cloud)
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          5. Use a VPN (especially on public wifi), the secure tunnel of a VPN is 
          a great way to protect yourself when you are on the web.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          6. Don't just use a random USB you found. if they are great at storing 
          files that can be easily shared, then a hacker will exploit this feature
          to the max
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>
