        <p>
          A ransomware attack is a form of malware where an attacker seizes the
          user's data, folders, or entire device until a ransom fee is paid. A
          ransomware attack exploits open security vulnerabilities by infecting
          a device or a network with either a phishing attack (Hacker
          impersonates someone internally to gain information) or via
          downloading from a malicious website (Which this site is not). A
          ransomware attack compromises a user's computer by either locking them
          out of their system or encrypting their files then demanding payment
          usually in a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin to restore access.
          <br />
          <br />
          These vulnerabilities come from software bugs that grant access to
          hijack a system. An attack can take place on almost any device. The
          victim device may include a computer, smartphone, wearable, POS
          (point-of-sale) electronic unit, etc.
          <br />
          <br />
          Ransomware attacks can be scaled from an individual, to an
          organization, or even a network of organizations and businesses.
          Distribution of this malware can be done in many techniques via
          attachment on phishing emails, downloading from an infected website,
          pop-ups, infected USBs, social media, malvertising, etc. Recently
          modern ransomware attacks are targeted at cloud, datacenter, and
          enterprise infrastructures.
